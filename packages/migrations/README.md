# `@accounter/migrations`

Service for creating, managing and running database migrations.

We are using [Slonik Migrator](https://github.com/mmkal/slonik-tools/tree/main/packages/migrator)
under the hood, to generate, manage, track and run migrations.

## Development Workflow

To add new migrations, please follow the instructions below, based on the type of the migration you
need to implement.

Please follow these guidelines:

1. Do not delete previous migration files!
2. Do not change any existing migration code or file name, once it's merged to `main` branch!
3. If you need a change in database or structure, make sure that the `down` migration does the exact
   opposite (usually, in the reversed order).
4. Migrations should not take too long to run - if your migration is doing too many things, please
   consider to break it to smaller pieces, or rethink your implemenation.
5. **Remember**: the database in production always contains more data: a tiny migration on
   development might take a long time to complete on production environment!

> Please refer to the `package.json` of this package for useful scripts that might make it simpler
> for you to write migrations.

## Adding new Postgres migrations

For postgres migrations, just create a new file (copy a previous migration).

Then, adjust the content and migration name as desired. Make sure you import in
[`src/run-pg-migrations.ts`](./src/run-pg-migrations.ts) and add it to the list of migrations to
run.

> If you need external dependencies at runtime, please make sure to add your dependencies under
> `dependencies` in `package.json`.

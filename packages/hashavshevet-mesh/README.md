# Errors and bugs

- getBatches: Can only fetch one at a time, due to errors on Hashavshevet's side. If filters applied
  (...and if not), only the first batch that matches it is returned. Note that creating a pdf report
  on UI does work for the exact same form. Current the only way to make it partially work is to ask
  for one batch each request. An alternative is to create form based on transactions, and filter
  response for unique items.
- getBatches: adding issueDate filter makes temporary batches (with no issue date) impossible to
  fetch, since filters are mandatory and not optional.
- getBatches: the first batch (id=1) which existed on Hashavshevet account (initDate = 01/01/1990)
  was impossible to retrieve via the form. might be filters issue.
- ImportTransactionsToBatch: the imported attribute DebitCredit(/debitOrCreditNumber) is flipped on
  server side (requesting the record's data will result in opposite value). In addition, results
  have values of -1/1, but documentation mentions 0/1 as acceptable values (in practice, -1 is also
  acceptable and behaves as 0).
- ImportTransactionsToBatch: ValueDate and DueDate are switched. the value of each is inputed into
  the other on server.
- Import: if a string contains the char '×´' it gets server error (502). happens for sure on
  ImportTransactionsToBatch>Description.
- Import quota limit: aperently there's a limit of 40 items in a single import (at least, on
  importBankPageMutation).
- Reference attribute limit: the Reference field (at least on bank pages) is limited to int32, any
  bigger num causes error.
- Ghost responses:When fetching data from Hashavshevet with export form, and activating filter (e.g
  getting a transaction by specific ID), and no match exists, the response is an item with NULLs in
  all attributes
- Updating data: currently there's no method for updating or deleting data via the API. Only
  importing and viewing.
- getRecords: The form in Hashavshevet on which this request is built, is derived from accounts
  catalogue. So if a transaction is imported with fault account ID, it will not appear on records
  requests.

# TODOs

- rename fields according to our convention
- complete missing calls commented on .meshrc.ymal
- after mesh fix, add "type": "module" to package,json (and can use node-fetch LTS for authToken
  req)
- find fix for "errors" attribute conflict between Mesh and hashavshevet

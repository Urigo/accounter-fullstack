# israeli-bank-scrapers-modern-schemas

A new architecture for Israeli bank scrapers to hopefully merge into
[Israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers) when they are ready

This project is very heavily inspired by
[israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers). I was using their
scrapers but needed to get:

1. The original and full responses from the scrapers and not a normalized one
2. Fully type safe, including the HTTP responses themselves
3. Verified against schemas - I wanted to be notified if a bank started sending something a bit
   different and to understand exactly each field they are sending

I believe this project could be integrated into the original bank scrapers. Or as a dependency (all
the additions above are optional with a config) or directly integrating the code.

Currently this library supports Bank Hapoalim, Bank Hapoalim business (with SMS login) and Isracard.

Should be easy to migrate more scrapers from
[israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers) into this new form.

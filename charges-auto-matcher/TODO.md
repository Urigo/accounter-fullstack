- Test coverage: >90%
- Number of tests: ~150-200
- Build time: <30 seconds
- Test suite time: <10 seconds

### Common Issues to Watch For

- Off-by-one errors in date calculations
- Floating point precision in amount comparisons
- Time zone handling in date comparisons
- Null/undefined handling throughout
- Error message clarity
- Performance with large datasets

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all pure functions
- Integration tests for services
- End-to-end tests for full workflows
- Edge case tests for all branches
- Performance tests for large datasets
